  The honor of your presence is our most precious gift.
  We know that many of you are traveling from afar to be with us on this special day, and your presence is truly the greatest gift we could wish for - just having you there means the world to us!
  For those of you who have asked about gifts, we'd like to say that we will be flying home after the celebration. As our new life together begins with this adventure in the air, monetary gifts would allow us to easily transport your well wishes and support to our new home.
  However, the most important thing for us is to celebrate this moment surrounded by the people we love. Your presence is the true treasure of our wedding.
